        Interactive Slideshow for Police Arrests from 2021-2023
    </h1>
    <div id="intro">
        This data set presents all the arrests in Montogomery County, Maryland. 
        Some factors that are presented in this data are: ethnicity, age, school zones, race and gender.
        Throughout this slideshow, I'll be displaying how these arrests were distributed amongst the above factors.
        At the end of the slideshow, I hope you'll be more educated on which groups of people were arrested proportionally more. 
        Even though this data is contained to one county, there are enough observations to make inferences on the distribution of arrests in other counties across the country.
        In this slideshow, you'll be able to get more details on the data points. 
        A tooltip will appear by hovering your mouse over the point of interest.
        The tooltip will look like the blue dot on the left of the screen.
